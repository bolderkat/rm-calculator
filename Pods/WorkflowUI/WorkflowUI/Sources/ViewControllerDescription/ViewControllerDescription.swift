    /// without needing to create one.
    ///
    /// The most common use case for a `ViewControllerDescription` is to return it from your `Screen`'s
    /// `viewControllerDescription(environment:)` method. The `WorkflowUI` machinery (or your
    /// custom container view controller) will then use this view controller description to create or update the
    /// on-screen presented view controller.
    ///
    /// As a creator of a custom container view controller, you will usually pass this view controller description to
    /// a `DescribedViewController`, which will internally create and manage the described view
    /// controller for its current view controller description. However, you can also directly invoke the public
